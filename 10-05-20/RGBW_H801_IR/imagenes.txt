I'm playing with your RGBW library.
I have added an IR receiver to capture signals from IR remote controls to control some of the functions.
Learn from any standard IR remote control to assign the keys on the remote to the functions.
It is a little green but if you are interested take a look.
this code is for H801 with a button on Gpio 0 and the IR receiver on Gpio3 "marked as TX on H801"
